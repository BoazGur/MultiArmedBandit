<h2> Advertisement Bandit </h2>

<p>
    The Advertisement Optimization Bandit represents the challenge faced by news websites in
    deciding which ads to display to their visitors. Each ad placement (bandit) has an unknown
    probability of being clicked on by a user, based on factors like the ad's content, the user's
    interests, and the placement's visibility. The goal is to maximize the total number of ad clicks
    (rewards) by dynamically allocating ads to different placements. <br>
    This problem is a manifestation of the multi-armed bandit problem in the context of online
    advertising. Just as a gambler must decide which slot machines to pull in a casino, a news
    website must decide which ads to display to its users. The challenge lies in balancing the
    exploration of new ads (to discover potentially profitable ones) with the exploitation of known
    profitable ads to maximize revenue. <br>
    The Advertisement Optimization Bandit class simulates this decision-making process by
    generating rewards based on the probability of a user clicking on an ad. This allows for the
    exploration and exploitation strategies to be tested and optimized, similar to how multi-armed
    bandit algorithms are used in A/B testing and other optimization problems.

<h2> Content Personalization Bandit </h2>

<p>
    The Content Personalization Bandit represents the challenge faced by streaming platforms in
    deciding which content to recommend to their users. Each content category (bandit) has an
    unknown probability of engaging a user, based on factors like the user's past viewing history,
    the content's genre, and the user's current mood or interests. The goal is to maximize the total 
    number of content engagements (rewards) by dynamically allocating content recommendations
    to different categories. <br>
    This problem is a manifestation of the multi-armed bandit problem in the context of content
    personalization. Just as a gambler must decide which slot machines to pull in a casino, a
    streaming platform must decide which content to recommend to its users. The challenge lies in
    balancing the exploration of new content categories (to discover potentially engaging ones)
    with the exploitation of known engaging content categories to maximize user satisfaction. <br>
    The Content Personalization Bandit class simulates this decision-making process by generating
    rewards based on the probability of a user engaging with a content category. This allows for the
    exploration and exploitation strategies to be tested and optimized, similar to how multi-armed
    bandit algorithms are used in A/B testing and other optimization problems.
